# Workmate
WorkMate connects customers with daily workers (like maids, cleaners) who are not online. Inspired by my personal need after moving from a hostel, it enables direct calls for accessibility, ensures privacy, and features a rating system for trust. Built with HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and SQL.
🚀 Problem It Solves
Finding trustworthy daily workers in new localities can be difficult, especially when most of them don’t have an online presence or know how to use apps. WorkMate bridges this gap by:

Listing verified local workers

Allowing direct calling instead of relying on in-app chat (for workers with limited digital literacy)

Ensuring quick access to essential services

🌟 Key Features
✅ Direct Calling: No app usage needed by workers; customers can contact them via phone directly.

✅ Privacy & Security: Minimal data is stored, and user privacy is prioritized.

✅ Mutual Rating System: Both workers and customers can rate each other to ensure transparency.

✅ Service Variety: Multiple types of workers listed for different daily needs.

✅ Quick Access: Connect with a service provider in minimal time.
